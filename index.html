                <p>This is my bio. It is an amazing bio. All who read my bio weep tears of joy and throw themselves
                    upon the ground in anguished ecstacy.
                    Perhaps you too are already incapacitated by the beauty of these words - fear not! It is only upon
                    first exposure that these reactions linger.
                    All you must do to attain sustainable bliss is hire me to a job offering a lucrative salary with
                    benefits. Please give me health insurance.
                    I really want health insurance.</p>

                <p>It's impossible to understate how important it is to have good words in here. This is how people
                    will establish a first impression of me and my work.
                    For now though, I'm putting in a string of whatever nonsense comes into my head, including this
                    meta-nonsense about the nonsense held within this
                    paragraph. Hopefully one day I will have good words - the best words - to populate this section,
                    but for now they remain the thoughtless drivel
                    of a thoughtless driveler.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I do hope to be forgiven for this nonsense, but I understand if you find it tedious and decline to
                    offer me a lucrative salary and benefits.
                    But mark my words - though now they may be lacking, one day I'll write better ones.
